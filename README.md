An HTML and CSS-built calculator application is a web application that displays a keypad and display to conduct arithmetic, HTML giving form and CSS determining the layout, colors, and responsive styling for ease of use on various devices. The actual calculation logic is often done in JavaScript, while the HTML marks out inputs and buttons and CSS organizes them into a readable, touch-friendly grid.​

What it does
A standard calculator has basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with symbols like percent, clear, backspace, and equals to express entire workflows. Most implementations have keyboard input support so users can input numbers and operators and press Enter to calculate.​

How HTML is used
HTML specifies the app's layout: a container, an immovable display of the current input/output, and a grid of operator and digit buttons that correspond to user actions. Markup frequently consists of an input or display component and button elements in rows or a table to emulate a handheld calculator and accommodate keyboard events.​

How CSS is applied
CSS layouts the keypad using grid or flexbox, manages spacing and sizing, and defines typography and color to create a legible and uniform interface. Responsive styles make sure the keypad and display change shape depending on screen width so the calculator is usable on phones and computers.​
Common interactions
Button presses or key depressions add characters to the screen, and invoking the equals action computes the expression to display the answer. Clear and backspace operations erase or modify the current input to avoid mistakes and enable easy corrections while entering.​

Extensions you can add
Scientific and utility functions such as power, square, and square root can be supplemented with special buttons and handlers to go beyond four-function mathematics. Alterations such as tip or percentage calculators can share the same HTML/CSS shell with minimal logic changes for specialized calculations.
